Important!

1) Make sure you have Python and Django installed in your machine.

2) On VSCode, or another IDE of your choice, set the directory in the integrated terminal to the project's directory. For example, since I am using Ubuntu, in my case this would be:
$ cd /home/antoniobrito/Antonio/1_Programming/from_HD/django_project_monthly_challenges

3) Next, run one of the following commands:
$ python3 manage.py runserver
$ python manage.py runserver

4) A message similar to this one will appear:
System check identified no issues (0 silenced).
